# Smart irrigation system for plants

This project is an academic project for the mechatronics course, which is designed as an intelligent irrigation system for plants. In this system, the plants are located around a water pump and a humidity sensor is connected to each plant. If the humidity percentage of the pot becomes less than the allowed limit, the pump will automatically move to the corresponding pot and inject water for it.

## Installation

To install and set up this system, please follow the instructions below:

1. Installing the Arduino IDE programming environment
2. Connect the Arduino Uno to your computer using a USB cable.
3. Download the code related to the project from the GitHub repository.
4. Open the code file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to the Arduino Uno board.

## Use

After installation and setup, the system is ready to work.By placing the plants around the water pump and connecting the humidity sensor to each plant, the system will start automatically. If the humidity percentage of the pot is less than the allowed limit, the pump will automatically move to the corresponding pot and inject water for it.
